# Streamlit-powered-Multi-Model-Predictive-Analysis-Platform-for-Credit-Card-Default-Detection

## Overview
This Streamlit-based web application combines data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models to predict credit card fraud. It provides an interactive platform for exploring credit card default data, visualizing trends, and building predictive models.

## Key Features
1. Data Exploration/EDA: Interactive Data exploration and visualisation
2. Model Building: Multiple machine learning models with customizable hyperparameters
3. Evaluation Metrics: Comprehensive model evaluation metrics
4. Streamlit Web App: User-friendly interface for making real-time fraud predictions based on user input.

## Requirements
1. Pandas
2. seaborn
3. streamlit
4. scikit-learn
5. matplotlib
6. plotly
7. imblearn

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/kiran-91/CreditFraud-Detection-Using-Streamlit.git
cd CreditFraud-Detection-Using-Streamlit
```

2. Setup a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```cmd
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```

3. Install required dependencies
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the streamlit app
```cmd
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage 
This Streamlit-powered platform helps detect credit card default risk using multiple machine learning models. Below are the steps to navigate and use the app

1. Explore the Dataset:
Head over to the "Explore the Dataset" tab to view the dataset. You can interact with the dataset and better understand the underlying data.

2. EDA:
In the "EDA" section, perform an exploratory analysis using visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, and more to extract insights from the dataset.

3. ML Model:
Switch to the "ML Model" tab to use various machine learning models of your choice for credit card default prediction.
Enhance model accuracy by applying sampling techniques for data balancing, adjusting hyperparameters, and input values. If unchanged, default settings will be used. Review performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and additional indicators

4. Future:
Explore the ideas for future improvements and potential features that could be added.
